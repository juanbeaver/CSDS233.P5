# P5 Progress Log

## Apr. 12, 2022, 8:00 PM

* Created the Skeleton for the Sort class and SortTester class.
* Started working on the insertionSort() method
  * Didn't have too much trouble with this implementation.

* Attempted to write the quickSort method
  * Had a lot of trouble with infinite recursion, or loops. Was not able to figure it out so I moved on to the mergeSort.
* Started the mergeSort method.
  * This sort is a lot easier to understand so I was able to get a decent idea mapped out before coding.

Time spent: 2 hr. (10% - 25%)

* I wasn't able to implement the merge sort using the subarray method used in class so instead i am going to try making actual arrays to pass on for each merge call.&#x20;
  * This was a lot easier to implement as it was easier to keep track of the different arrays and iterating variables.&#x20;

Time spent: 45 min (50% done)

* Finished the quickSort method.&#x20;
  * At first I was having some issues with the way i was choosing my pivot so I went with choosing the last value as the pivot.&#x20;
  * This sort was also difficult understand for me, but after going for a simpler solution, I was able to get the right result.&#x20;
* Started completing my SortTester class.

Time Spent: 40 min (90% done)
