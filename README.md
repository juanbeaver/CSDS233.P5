* Attempted to write the quickSort method&#x20;
  * Had a lot of trouble with infinite recursion, or loops. Was not able to figure it out so I moved on to the mergeSort.
* Started the mergeSort method.&#x20;
  * This sort is a lot easier to understand so I was able to get a decent idea mapped out before coding.&#x20;

Time spent: 2 hr. (10% - 25%)&#x20;
